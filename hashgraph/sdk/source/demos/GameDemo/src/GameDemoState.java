/**
 * The state for the game demo. See the comments for GameDemoMain.
 *
 * There are several issues to consider when designing what state to store for a game, and what actions the
 * players can perform. For example, is a game involves each player having a location in 2D space, the
 * obvious choice of state and action for each player would be:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     State:  (x, y)
 *     Action: (dx, dy)
 * </pre>
 *
 * So the (x,y) coordinates for the player Alice would be stored. And when she wants to move a distance dx
 * horizontally and a distance dy vertically, she would take that (dx,dy) action and add any additional
 * information she needed, to form a transaction, which she would send to all the other players. Then Bob
 * would change Alice's position in his state to (x+dx,y+dy), and move the marker on his screen to show
 * Alice's new location.
 *
 * But there is a problem. Movement will not be smooth. On Bob's screen, Alice will seem to be motionless
 * for a while, then jump to a new location, then be motionless for a while, and so on. So a better approach
 * might be:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     State:  (t0, x0, y0, vx, vy)
 *     Action: (vx, vy)
 * </pre>
 *
 * Now, the state records that at time t0, Alice was at location (x0,y0) and moving with velocity (vx,vy).
 * So at time t, Bob can draw Alice's marker on the screen at location (x0 + t*vx, y0 + t*vy). Then the
 * marker for Alice will move smoothly at all times. And when Alice wants to change her velocity, she can
 * create a transaction out of the action (vs,vy), which gives her new velocity.
 *
 * But there is still a problem. Suppose Alice wants to move straight north for a while until she is at the
 * same latitude as the goal, then turn east until she reaches the goal. The problem is that she will need
 * to make sure that the transaction that changes her direction from north to east will have a consensus
 * timestamp of exactly the moment when her position is due west of the goal. But when she creates the
 * transaction, she can never be sure exactly what its consensus timestamp will end up being. So she will
 * not be able to navigate well. The solution to that problem is to do this:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     State:  (t0, x0, y0, gx, gy, s)
 *     Action: (gx, gy, s)
 * </pre>
 *
 * Now, the state for Alice includes the information that at time t0 she was at location (x0,y0), and that
 * she was heading toward a goal position of (gx,gy) at a speed of s units per second. If she ever decides
 * to change this, her action will give a new goal location and speed.
 *
 * Now, at time t, Bob can calculate the fraction r of the distance to the goal that Alice has moved:
 *
 * <pre>
 * r = min(1,
 * 		(t - t0) * s / sqrt((gx - x0) * (gx - x0) + (gy - y0) * (gy - y0)));
 * </pre>
 *
 * This is the time that she has been moving (seconds), times her speed (meters per second), divided by the
 * distance she needed to travel (meters). That is the fraction of the distance she has covered so far, as
 * of time t. This is then clipped at 1, so that she won't overshoot the goal. So on Bob's screen, it will
 * show Alice moving smoothly toward the goal at the appropriate speed, and then stopping once the goal has
 * been reached.
 *
 * This is also a good system for Alice. She can submit a transaction to move due north, then another to
 * move due east, to end up at the goal. But she will actually implement that as a first transaction that
 * says to move north to the turning point, followed by a later transaction that says to move directly to
 * the goal. She will submit the second at a moment chosen so that its consensus timestamp matches the time
 * she will actually reach the turning point.
 *
 * This still involves guessing what the consensus timestamp will be. But small errors in the guess won't do
 * any harm. If the timestamp is later than expected, then she will move to the turning point, pause
 * briefly, then move to the goal. If the timestamp is earlier than expected, then she will move to a point
 * just short of the turning point, then turn onto an angle that is mostly east and slightly tilted to the
 * north, and then end up exactly at the goal. Either way, she ends up exactly at the goal. And she turns at
 * a time and location close to her desired time and location.
 *
 * The only remaining issues are what t0 Bob should store in the state, what t he should use when displaying
 * Alice's position, and what t Alice should use when estimating what consensus timestamp a given action
 * will end up with.
 *
 * When Bob receives a transaction that updates Alice's position, he should set t0 to the time that the
 * Platform passes to handleTransaction. If the transaction happens to have consensus==true, then this time
 * is correct. If consensus==false, then the time is an estimate that the Platform calculates as to what the
 * consensus timestamp will probably be when the consensus is eventually reached for that transaction. The
 * Platform estimates this based on measurements of recent network and consensus performance.
 *
 * When Bob is displaying Alice's position, he needs to know the time t to use in the above equations. When
 * Alice is deciding what action to do at a given moment, she must guess what time t will end up being the
 * consensus timestamp for a transaction created at that moment. In both cases, the best value of t is found
 * by calling platform.estTime(). This estimate by the Platform is also based on measurements of recent
 * network and consensus performance. So with this estimate, the screen will display how the world should
 * look at that time, and when a user gives some input, it should actually take effect at the moment that
 * the screen is displaying. There can be estimation errors, but this should give the best results.
