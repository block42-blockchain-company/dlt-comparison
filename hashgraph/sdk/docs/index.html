<h1>Swirlds SDK</h1>

The Swirlds SDK contains the Swirlds browser, example apps with source code that can run in that browser, and
documentation for installing, running, and writing new apps using Eclipse.

<h2>Version history</h2>

<b> Version 18.12.30</b><br>
Updated file system documentation. Deprecated old file system method names and introduced updated method names.
Added additional statistics.
New setting "waitAtStartup" added to config.txt.
Added new method to SwirldMain API called "platformStatusChange".
<br><br>

<b> Version 18.10.23</b><br>
Runs on JDK 10. Support for ed25519 signature verification.
Small improvements in the API, which require small changes in the apps, as shown in the
source code of the demo apps. <br><br>

<b> Version 18.05.23</b><br>
Minor improvements, bug fixes, performance tweaks. <br><br>

<b> Version 18.02.27</b><br>
The platform now predicts an estimated consensus timestamp for transactions that don't yet have consensus. The GameDemo
app has been restructured to take advantage of this new feature. <br><br>

<b> Version 17.09.15</b><br>
Added a browser window showing various aspects of how the network is performing. <br><br>

<b> Version 17.06.11</b><br>
Enabled TLS. All communication is encrypted with TLS 1.2, with algorithms and key sizes chosen to conform to the
Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite
<a href="https://www.iad.gov/iad/library/ia-guidance/ia-solutions-for-classified/algorithm-guidance/commercial-national-security-algorithm-suite-factsheet.cfm">(CNSA
	suite)</a>, using the Java 8 cipher suite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384. Documentation is now available
for <a href="keyManagement.html">key management</a>. <br><br>

<b>Version 17.01.18</b><br>
Added documentation and support for developing new apps without Eclipse. App development can now be done from the
command line using only Java, Maven, and a text editor.<br><br>

<b>Version 17.01.04</b><br>
Added NAT piercing. If this is run on a machine behind a router that does Network Address Translation (NAT), then it
will now tell the router to set up port forwarding, so that computers outside the router can communicate with it. This
will use either uPNP or NAT-PMP, whichever the router supports. <br><br>

<b>Version 16.12.11</b><br>
Added a new fast copyable filesystem, and a FilesystemDemo app to demonstrate it. This means the app can create what
appears to be an external hard drive, and can create files and directories on it. But it is actually shared between all
the members, and all of them see a single, consistent view of it as it changes over time. Furthermore, even if it has
grown very large, an app can make a "fast copy" of it, which appears to be a new external drive containing an exact copy
of all the bytes on the original drive. Both the original and copy can then be modified independently. The "fast copy"
happens almost instantly because of a copy-on-write mechanism that causes information to only be truly copied when a
file changes. <br><br>

<b>Version 16.10.05</b><br>
Added two new demos. The StatsDemo collects various statistics about the running system, such as transactions per
second, and writes them to a CSV file. The CryptocurrencyDemo app demonstrates a simulated stock market running on a
real cryptocurrency (at least it would be real if the program were to be allowed to run forever, and encryption were
turned on). This also allows unlimited numbers of members.<br><br>

<b>Version 16.08.11</b><br>
This is the initial Alpha release of the Swirlds platform and SDK. This is just a very early Alpha version. It doesn't
have signatures and security, it only has a limited set of features, the API may change, and future releases will flesh
out more of the core features. This supports up to three computers running the browser and communicating over the
internet, or three instances can run on a single machine. Either way, they should be started at the same time, in order
to connect with each other.<br><br>
