<h1>How to install / recompile the example apps in Eclipse</h1>

These versions (or later) should be downloaded and installed:

<ul>
<li>Oracle Java SE 10: <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase10-4425482.html">
  Oracle Java SE Development Kit 10.0.2</a> </li>

<li>Eclipse 4.7 (Oxygen):  
<a href="https://eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse IDE for Java Developers</a> (EE is also ok).</li>

<li> Swirlds SDK: <a href="http://www.swirlds.com/download/">Swirlds SDK</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The above link is to Oracle JDK 10, which is free. Oracle JDK 11 will not be free. 
Future releases of the Swirlds SDK will be designed for OpenJDK 11 and beyond, which are free.</p>

<p>If the Swirlds browser freezes when it is first launched, it is possible that the operating system needs a utility installed to collect entropy, such as the utilities for 
<a href="installDebian.html">Debian</a>
or
<a href="installRaspbian.html">Raspbian</a>, which may also work on other versions of Linux or Unix.

<p>The examples below use slashes in paths, but on Windows they will be backslashes.</p>

Eclipse creates a <b>workspace</b> directory on your drive. Find it and ensure the files from the SDK are there.  The <b>sdk</b> directory should be put somewhere in the directory tree under the Eclipse <b>workspace</b> directory.  For example, the needed files might be put here:
<ul>
<li> <b>workspace/git/sdk/data/apps/ </b></li>
<li> <b>workspace/git/sdk/swirlds.jar </b></li>
<li> <b>workspace/git/sdk/config.txt </b></li>
</ul>

<p>The last one, <b>config.txt</b>, is used to make the Swirlds browser automatically run a particular app. It can even make multiple instances of it run and communicate with each other, as if they were on multiple machines. The comments in the file explain how to change it.</p>

<p>The demo apps are now <a href="runBrowser.html">ready to run</a>.  </p>

<p>The apps come with source code, and can be recompiled in Eclipse.  To import the projects into Eclipse and recompile them:</p>

<ul>

<li>
import the demo projects
<ul>
<li>choose menu WINDOW > SHOW VIEW > OTHER > JAVA > PACKAGE EXPLORER  (if the package explorer isn't already visible)</li>
<li>select menu FILE > IMPORT</li>
<li>click the triangle by MAVEN if it doesn't have entries under it </li>
<li>click EXISTING MAVEN PROJECTS</li>
<li>click NEXT</li>
<li>click the BROWSE button in the upper-right, on the same line as ROOT DIRECTORY</li>
<li>go to and select the <b>sdk</b> directory, such as <b>workspace/git/sdk/</b></li>
<li>click OPEN</li>
<li>make sure the checkboxes by all the listed projects are checked</li>
<li>click FINISH</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
recompile and run HashgraphDemo
<ul>
<li> edit the <b>config.txt</b> file to choose which app to run. The instructions are given as comments in the file.</li>
<li> in the package explorer, click on the triangle by <b>HashgraphDemo</b> to open it
<li> right click on the <b>pom.xml</b> under <b>HashgraphDemo</b> and choose RUN AS > MAVEN INSTALL</li>
<li> click on <b>src</b> under <b>HashgraphDemo</b> to select it </li>
<li> click the green arrow button on the top bar to run it </li>
<li> if it asks, click JAVA APPLICATION and click OK </li>
<li> it won't run yet, but that's ok </li>
<li> select menu RUN > RUN CONFIGURATIONS</li>
<li> select the ARGUMENTS tab</li>
<li> under WORKING DIRECTORY select OTHER</li>
<li> click FILESYSTEM and navigate to just inside the <b>sdk</b> directory</li> 
<li> click OPEN</li>
<li> click APPLY</li>
<li> click CLOSE</li>
<li> in the package explorer click on <b>src</b> under <b>HashgraphDemo</b> to select it </li>
<li> click the green arrow button on the top bar to run it </li>
<li> the app should run. When you are done with it, choose QUIT under its menu, or close its window. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>recompile and run each of the other demos, using the above steps
</ul>

<p>At this point, all of the demos have been recompiled, and their new <b>.jar</b> files have been stored in the <b>data/apps</b> folder for the browser to use. If you change the source code of one of the apps, repeat the above steps to recompile it (do a MAVEN INSTALL) and run it  (click the green arrow). It is possible to 
<a href="runBrowser.html">run the new app</a>, either in the browser, or from the command line, or in Eclipse itself.</p>
