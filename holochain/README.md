# Holochain

This is the GoT implementation with Holochain

We use `holochain-rust`. If you never programmed with rust before, it is recommended to do a rust crash course beforehand, so you can differentiate between rust specific syntax and holochain specific syntax.

To get started, install everything as described in the quickstart tutorial: https://developer.holochain.org/start.html

To build the desired `*.dna.json` file, open a terminal, cd into the game-of-thrones folder and run `hc package`. Afterwards, to run the tests, run `hc test` inside the `game-of-thrones` folder.

This implementation is based on the tutorial of the official holochain guidebook:
https://developer.holochain.org/guide/latest/first_steps.html

Make sure to read the first 4 chapters of this guidebook, they give you the basic understanding you need to develop a holochain based dApp.
