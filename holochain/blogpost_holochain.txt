Holochain is a protocol to enable peer to peer applications.
Other than in blockchain, holochain doesn't provide a global
consensus, but more a shared consensus between parties that interact
with each other. Because of that, holochain doesn't face the problems
that blockchains face, like scalability or transaction speed.
Each application powered by holochain, is itself its own network. 
So there is not one chain like in ethereum for example, but a separate
isolated chain for every dApp.

A technical overview:
Each user is a node. Instead of sharing consensus about data, all the nodes share 
consensus about the validation rules of transactions. So the dApp is
basically a set of rules, on what kind of transactions are valid and
what are not.
Each node stores a hashchain of its own transaction on his own device.
All transactions are signed by the nodes public key. 
To share transactions with the network, the network is organized as 
a distributed hashtable (DHT). So if a node makes a transaction that is 
needed for interacting with the network, the two interacting parties
send it to several other nodes. They send it to other nodes,
which public keys are similar to the hash of the to be 
stored transaction. That way it's possible to detect fraud, and not losing
the transaction if a single node goes offline.

Let's take the classical problem of double spending (a user issues two 
transactions spending all his funds, though he could only spend it once):
Eve sends a signed transaction spending all her money to Alice to receive goods
from Alice in return. Some time later, Eve sends another signed transaction to Bob,
where she tries to spend the money she already sent to Alice. Because in each transaction 
the hash of the previous transaction is noted, Bob can look up the previous
transaction on the DHT. In this previous transaction, the hash of the transaction
before this previous transaction can be found, and so on. Once Bob finds the
transaction of Eve to Alice, he knows that Eve in reality doesn't have money anymore,
and reject Eve's payment. In addition, he will show the rest of the network 
this malicious transaction signed by Eve, and every node will stop communicating
with Eve because of this incident. This way, the network kicks out dishonest users.

One final thing to note: when a node goes offline, i.e. other nodes do not receive
messages from this node anymore, they will mark it as offline. Transactions have to 
be stored redundantly on more nodes than a specific threshold of nodes, for example on 5 nodes.
If a node goes offline, the network checks on how many nodes a transaction that was formerly stored
on that offline node is accessible. If it is only stored on 4 other nodes, the network automatically copies this
transaction to a new node, so that there are 5 copies again in the network.

Implementation:
The implementation of our game of thrones use case, was done with the 
help of holochains development kit (hdk) for rust. We followed the installation
steps from the quickstart tutorial (https://developer.holochain.org/start.html)
and developed our dApp with the help of the guidebook (https://developer.holochain.org/guide/latest/first_steps.html).
If you never programmed with rust before, it is recommended to do a rust crash course beforehand, 
so you can differentiate between rust specific syntax and holochain specific syntax.
Holochain apps are made of one or more so called "zomes", they are something 
like modules in javascript. Each zome provides logic. 
Every zome is compiled to WebAssembly, therefore one can write collaborating zomes
in many different programming languages, and not only rust.
The zomes get compiled into a *.dna.json file, which contains the zomes code as WebAssembly.
To test this dna file, we used the node testing framework Tape.js.
