# dlt-comparison
In this project several distributed ledger technology (DLT) are compared by implementing a game of thrones use case.

We implement the following use case:

2 or more alliances are at war with each other.
An alliance consists of one or more families.
Due to intrigues and other events, families can change alliances.

We represent the alliances and the families as assets.
The possibility to create a family or an alliance is a transaction.
The attachment of a family to an alliance is a transaction.
The transfer of a family to another alliance is a transaction.

We only try to interact with the DLT via command line interface (cli) or code, and do not provide a user interface (UI).

The to be analyzed distributed ledger technologies are:
Holochain
BigChainDB
Hashgraph
Dragonchain
0bsNetwork
Ethereum
