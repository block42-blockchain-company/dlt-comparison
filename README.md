# Distributed Ledger Comparison üçéüçê

In this project several distributed ledger technology (DLT) are compared by implementing a game of thrones use case.

## Usecase

We implement the following use case:
* 2 or more alliances are at war with each other
* An alliance consists of one or more families
* Due to intrigues and other events, families can change alliances

## Tech

We represent the alliances and the families as assets.
The possibility to create a family or an alliance is a transaction.
The attachment of a family to an alliance is a transaction.
The transfer of a family to another alliance is a transaction.

We only try to interact with the DLT via command line interface (cli) or code, and do not provide a user interface (UI).

## Frameworks

The to be analyzed distributed ledger technologies are:

* ICON
* Holochain
* BigChainDB
* Hashgraph
* Dragonchain
* 0bsNetwork
* Ethereum
