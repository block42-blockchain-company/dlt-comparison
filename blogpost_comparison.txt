Yes we did it! We reviewed 6 distributed ledger technologies (DLT's),
and implemented with each DLT a game of thrones use case. 
The idea was to find out how easy it is to get a simple use case
up and running on various DLT's. We wanted to implement the same use case in every DLT.
Something a little bit more complex than just a simple 'Hello World!', so we have
to tweak sample code according to our requirements. The requirements are based on
game of thrones, because it should be possible to create alliances, like the alliance
'Khaleesi' or 'Cercei', and to create and add families ('Stark', 'Lannister') to the alliances. 
Hence, every alliance can have multiple families, and those families can be transfered
between alliances in the case that they change sides. 
That way we had to understand the basic concepts of how to build applications on the particular DLT.

As most of the reviewed technologies are rather young, there isn't a whole
lot of knowledge about them to find in the internet. What was key to an easy and
straight forward implementation, was the documentation and tutorials for the 
inspected DLT. However, often the documentation wasn't complete or something didn't
work on our computers as described in the provided resources. In that case, we were
very thankful for the chats of the DLT's. We were positively surprised that every
DLT had a company driven chat on telegram, discord, gitter or something similar
where our questions were answered directly from people responsible for the projects.
Furthermore, no matter how good a documentation or a chat-answer is, the ease of 
the setup was directly tied to the DLT itself. In the case of simple API-calls,
the implementation was much easier than compared to having to set up a node or to learn
a new DLT-specific language.

In the following, we compared our inspected DLT's by 5 metrics: 
- Novelty of the DLT
- Complexity of its theory
- Complexity of the setup
- Quality of the documentation
- Responsiveness in chats

We also indicated whether the technology is a private (only permissioned users can join) 
or public (everyone can join) network, and whether there's the possibility of storing
sensible data without disclosing it to the public or encrypting it.

Please note that we have a strong blockchain background, and already worked with
DLT's like Ethereum. Therefore, big blockchain's like Bitcoin and Ethereum are state-of-the-art
DLT's for us, and for us those blockchains are the base of novelty. We don't intend
to say that Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake blockchain is not a novel technology, 
of course it is. But in our comparison we put them
